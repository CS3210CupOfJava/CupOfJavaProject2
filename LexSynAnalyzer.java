/*  Project 2: Lexical and Syntax Analysis
 *  
 * Write a program language of your choice that takes in a Java program as an input and does the 
 * following tasks:
 * 
 * 1. Check to make sure all decision structures (if, if-else, if-else-if, switch) use curly braces
 * appropriately. If not, fix it. Assume that single statement block is also required to include 
 * curly braces.
 * 
 * 2. Check to make sure all loop structures (while, do-while, for) use curly braces
 * appropriately. If not, fix it. Assume that single statement block is also required to include 
 * curly braces.
 * 
 * 3. Check to make sure all the method structure is syntactically correct. If not, fix it.
 * 
 * 4. Count how many time the keyword “public” is used as keywords in the input program.
 * 
 * 5. Then your program will print to a text file the original input program, the updated input 
 * program, and the number of time keyword “public” is used.
